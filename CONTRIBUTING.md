## Code Style

- We use Black for code formatting
- Ruff for linting
- MyPy for type checking
- All code must be type-annotated
- Maximum line length is 100 characters
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines

## Testing

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Tests should be clear and meaningful
- Use pytest fixtures when appropriate

## Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb in the present tense
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Add details in the commit body if needed

## Pull Requests

- Reference any related issues
- Include a clear description of changes
- Update documentation if needed
- Ensure all checks pass
- Keep changes focused and atomic

## Release Process

Releases are automated through GitHub Actions when tags are pushed:

1. Ensure all tests pass on main
2. Tag the release:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release v0.1.0"
   ```
3. Push tags:
   ```bash
   git push --tags
   ```

The GitHub Action will automatically:
- Run all tests
- Build the package
- Publish to PyPI
